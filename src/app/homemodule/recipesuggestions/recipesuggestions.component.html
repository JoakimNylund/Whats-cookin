          People have been eating blueberries for more than 13,000 years and for good reason.
          It is low in calories but high in fibre, vitamin C and vitamin K. The silvery sheen (or “bloom”) 
          found on the skin of blueberries is a naturally occurring compound that helps protect the fruit. That is why you should only wash 
          blueberries just before you’re going to eat them. The berries should be stored in the refrigerator and will keep fresh for up to 10 days.
